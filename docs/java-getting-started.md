This guide will help you get the most of the Mindee Java client library to easily extract data from your documents.

> ðŸ“˜ **Info**
>
> The library is written and compiled with Java 8. This guide assumes you have a compatible JVM language installed

## Installation

### Prerequisites
You'll need [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) downloaded 
and [installed](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

### Maven
The easiest way to use the Mindee client library for your project is by adding 
the maven dependency in your projects POM:

```shell
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
      <artifactId>mindee-api-java</artifactId>
      <groupId>com.mindee.sdk</groupId>
      <version>${mindee.sdk.version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependency>
<properties>
    ...
    <mindee.sdk.version>1.0.0</mindee.sdk.version>
</properties>
```
For the latest version of the Library please refer to our [maven central repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.mindee.sdk/mindee-api-java)

### Development Installation
If you'll be modifying the source code, you'll need to follow these steps to get started.

1. First clone the repo.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:mindee/mindee-api-java.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory and install all required libraries.

```shell
mvn clean install 
```

## Updating the Library
When starting out it is recommended that you use the latest release version of the library from our [maven central repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.mindee.sdk/mindee-api-java). Future updates can be made using the [maven versions plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/).

```shell
mvn versions:use-next-releases -Dincludes=com.mindee.sdk:mindee-api-java
```

## Usage
Using Mindee's APIs can be broken down into the following steps:
1. [Initialize a `Client`](#initializing-the-client)
2. [Load a file](#loading-a-document-file)
3. [Send the file](#sending-a-document) to Mindee's API
4. [Retrieve the response](#retrieving-the-response)
5. [Process the response](#processing-the-response) in some way

Let's take a deep dive into how this works.

### Initializing the Client
The `com.mindee.MindeeClient` class centralizes document configurations into a single class.

The `MindeeClient` requires your [API key](https://developers.mindee.com/docs/make-your-first-request#create-an-api-key).

You can either pass these directly to the constructor or through environment variables.

#### Pass the API key directly
```java
import com.mindee;

// Init a new client and passing the key directly
MindeeClient client = MindeeClientInit.create("<your mindee api key>");
```

#### Set the API key in the environment
API keys can be set as environment variables.

The following environment variable will set the global API key:
```shell
MINDEE_API_KEY="my-api-key"
```

Then in your code:
```java
// Init a new client without an API key
MindeeClient client = MindeeClientInit.create();
```

### Loading a Document File
Before being able to send a document to the API, it must first be loaded.

You don't need to worry about different MIME types, the library will take care of handling
all supported types automatically.

Once a document is loaded, interacting with it is done in exactly the same way, regardless
of how it was loaded.

There are a few different ways of loading a document file, depending on your use case:
* [File](#file-object)
* [Base64](#base64)
* [Byte Array](#bytes)

The `MindeeClient` class provides overloaded `loadDocument` methods for these three input types. The `loadDocument` method returns an object of the `DocumentToParse` class which can be used for further interactions with the API.

#### File Object
Load a `java.io.File` object. When using this option you do not need to pass in a file name - the API uses the `file.getName()` method to get the file name.

```java
DocumentToParse documentToParse = mindeeClient.loadDocument(
    new File("path/to/document/document.pdf"));
```

#### Base64
Load file contents from a base64-encoded string.

**Note**: The filename of the encoded file is required when calling the method.

```java
String b64String = "/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD/2wBDAAgGBgcGBQgHBwcJCQgKDBQNDAsLD....";
DocumentToParse documentToParse = mindeeClient.loadDocument(b64String,"document.pdf");
```

#### Bytes
Load file contents from a byte array.

**Note**: The original filename of the encoded file is required when calling the method.

```java
// Get Byte Array from a File, Multipart File, Input Stream, or as a method parameter
byte[] fileAsBytes = ....;
DocumentToParse documentToParse = mindeeClient.loadDocument(fileAsBytes,"document.pdf");
```

### Parsing a Document
The `MindeeClient` has multiple overloaded `parse` methods available for parsing the documents 
and you will get `DocumentToParse`.

This can be done by implicitly by calling the `parse(Class<T> type)` method with the expected response type from the parse method (`InvoiceResponse`, `ReceiptResponse`, `PassportResponse`, or even you custom class !)
Each document type available in the library has its corresponding `Response` class.
This is detailed in each document-specific guide.


#### Off-the-Shelf Documents
Simply setting the correct class is enough:
```java
// After the document has been loaded
Document<ReceiptV4Inference> receiptV4Inference = 
  mindeeClient.parse(ReceiptV4Inference.class, documentToParse);
```

For more finer grained control over parsing the documents you can have a look on the `parse` override method.

#### Custom Documents
In this case, you will have two ways to handle them.

The first one enables the possibility to use a class object which represents a kind of dictionary where,
keys will be the name of each field define in your Custom API model (on the Mindee platform).

It also requires that you instantiate a new `CustomEndpoint` object to define the information of your custom API built.
```java
CustomEndpoint myEndpoint = new CustomEndpoint(
    "wnine",
    "john",
    "1.0" // optional
);

Document<CustomV1Inference> customDocument = mindeeClient
    .parse(documentToParse, myEndpoint);
```

The second one is using your own class.
See more information [here](#java-api-builder)

### Processing the Response
Regardless of the model, it will be encapsulated in a `Document` object and therefore will have the following attributes:
* `inference` â€” [Inference](#inference)

#### Inference
Regroup the prediction on all the pages of the document and the prediction for all the document.
* `documentPrediction` â€” [Document level prediction](#document-level-prediction)
* `pagesPrediction` â€” [Page level prediction](#page-level-prediction)

#### Document Level Prediction
The Response object for each document type has an attribute that represents data extracted from the entire document. It's possible to have the same field in various pages, but at the document level only the highest confidence field data will be shown (this is all done automatically at the API level).


```java
Document<InvoiceV4Inference> invoiceDocument = 
  documentClient.parse(InvoiceV4Inference.class, documentToParse);
// print the complete object
logger.info(invoiceDocument.toString());

// print the document-level info
logger.info(invoiceResponse.documentPrediction.toString());

// print the page-level info
logger.info(invoiceResponse.documentPrediction.toString());

```

Each inference specific class will have its own specific attributes, which correspond to the various fields extracted from the document.


#### Page Level Prediction
The `pagesPrediction` attribute is a list of `prediction` object, often of the same class as the [`documentPrediction` attribute](#document-level-prediction).
But sometimes, it could have a different class which will extends the `documentPrediction` class.

Each page element contains the data extracted for a particular page of the document.
